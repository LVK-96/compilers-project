Pros:
    + We wrote a script to automatically test that our parser passes the given test cases
    + We wrote our own parse table generator since the suggested tool was broken
    + We refactored our scanner to improve its readability
Cons:
    - Our parser has has almost 300 lines of hard coded lists and tables in the start.
      It would be better to have them in separate files, but since we are supposed to
      turn in only the README, scanner.py and parser.py they need to be included that way.
